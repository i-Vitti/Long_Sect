# Long_Sect
A refined OCR that extracts data from longitudinal drawings and outputs a table of data for users to copy and paste elsewhere for use. This app is aiming to ease the manual process of data extraction particuarly from old "blue and brown print" drawings

Additional Notes
If you’re using ImageMagick as an external tool, there’s no need to list it in requirements.txt since it’s a system-level dependency.
Ensure ImageMagick is installed on the target system and accessible in the PATH environment variable.
